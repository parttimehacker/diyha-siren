## Project name: 

diyha-siren

## Description: 
Raspberry Pi project that implements a loud pulsing siren and flashing red LED as part of a larger "do it yourself home automation" system.  The systemd service is written in Pyhton3. The siren and LED are powered by a 12 volt battery.

## Table of Contents: 
Optionally, include a table of contents in order to allow other people to quickly navigate especially long or detailed READMEs.

## Installation: 
Installation is a two step process. First import two pip3 libraries. MQTT is used to subscribe and publish "do it yourself home automation" topics. The second step is to create a systemd service so the application starts when rebooted or via user commands.

step 1 - installation
```chmod +x *.sh
./installation-script.sh
```
step2 - create the systemd service
```
./systemd-script.sh diyha-siren
```
## Usage: 
The next section is usage, in which you instruct other people on how to use your project after theyâ€™ve installed it. This would also be a good place to include screenshots of your project in action.

## Contributing: 
Larger projects often have sections on contributing to their project, in which contribution instructions are outlined. Sometimes, this is a separate file. If you have specific contribution preferences, explain them so that other developers know how to best contribute to your work.
