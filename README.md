# Table of Contents: 
Optionally, include a table of contents in order to allow other people to quickly navigate especially long or detailed READMEs.

# Installation: 
Installation is the next section in an effective README. Tell other users how to install your project locally. Optionally, include a gif to make the process even more clear for other people.

If you have specific contribution preferences, explain them so that other developers know how to best contribute to your work. To learn more about how to help others contribute, check out the guide for setting guidelines for repository contributors.
